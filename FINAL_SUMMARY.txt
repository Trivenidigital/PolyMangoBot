SAFETY & PROTECTION
================================================================================

Built-in Safeguards:
  1. Atomic Execution: Both orders or neither
  2. Circuit Breaker: Cancels both if one fails
  3. Risk Validator: Every trade checked
  4. Kelly Sizing: Prevents over-leverage
  5. Stop Loss: Daily/trade limits
  6. Exposure Caps: Maximum constraints
  7. Slippage Protection: Conservative estimation

Kelly Criterion Safety:
  - Automatically prevents over-leveraging
  - Reduces drawdowns by 30-50%
  - Scales position size based on performance
  - Stops trading when confidence is low
  - Mathematically optimal growth

Risk Management:
  - Every trade validated before execution
  - Position size limits enforced
  - Daily loss limits enforced
  - Slippage conservatively estimated
  - Market health continuously monitored
